Feedly Tagger
============================
This is an extension for Firefox powered by the [Mozilla Jetpack](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/index.html)


What it does
------------

Using [feedly](http://feedly.com) you could need to tag the item you are reading, this is a boring process because you need to scroll to the 'Tag' button, click on it, enter text and finally press the 'Create' button.

Feedly Tagger tries to simplify this process adding a shortkey to press when you are on an item.

How to use
----------

**You must use the 'Full Article' layout on feedly otherwise Feedly Tagger doesn't work.**

1. Go to [cloud.feedly.com](http://cloud.feedly.com/) and login using your credentials
2. Move to an item as your normal navigation
3. Press the `F2` key (or the `/` key)
4. The tag input box is automatically opened and filled with the article title
5. Press the Create button and your tag is saved
